# Exploring U.S. Bikeshare Data with Python: A Udacity Project

## Description
This project utilizes a Python script to explore and provide analysis on U.S. Bikeshare data for three major cities: Chicago, Washington, and New York City.

The data analysis focuses on these key data points in order, which are taken directly from Udacity's project details:

### Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)**

**most common month
  most common day of week
  most common hour of day**

### Popular stations and trip 

**most common start station
  most common end station
  most common trip from start to end**

### Trip duration 

**total travel time
  average travel time**

### User info

**counts of each user type
 counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
 earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)**

The script is interactive and prompts for user input, which dictates what data is shown.  The user also has the option to view raw data from the .csv files at the end.

## Files used
The main script is "bikeshare.py"; it uses these files respectively:

chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

## Credits
All credit goes to Udacity for providing the opportunity and access to work on this great project!  Also, a big thank you goes out to Motivate, the bike share system provider that made this dataset possible.
