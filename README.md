# Exploring U.S. Bikeshare Data with Python: A Udacity Project

## Description
This project utilizes a Python script to explore and provide analysis on U.S. Bikeshare data for three major cities: Chicago, Washington, and New York City.

The data analysis focuses on these key data points in order, which are taken directly from Udacity's project details:

### Popular times of travel:

* Most common month
* Most common day of week
* Most common hour of day

### Popular stations and trip:

* Most common start station
* Most common end station
* Most common trip from start to end

### Trip duration: 

* Total travel time
* Average travel time

### User info:

* Counts of each user type
* Counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* Earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (_only available for NYC and Chicago_)

The script is interactive and prompts for user input, which dictates what data is shown.  The user also has the option to view raw data from the .csv files at the end.

## Files used
The main script is `bikeshare.py`; it uses these files respectively:

* `chicago.csv`
* `new_york_city.csv`
* `washington.csv`

## Credits
All credit goes to Udacity for providing the opportunity and access to work on this great project!  Also, a big thank you goes out to Motivate, the bike share system provider that made this dataset possible.
